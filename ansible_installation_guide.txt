Step #1: Add the EPEL Repository
Ansible is part of Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL), which is a community repository of non-standard packages for the RHEL distribution. First, we’ll install the EPEL repository:

sudo rpm -iUvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm

Step #2: The Installation
As a matter of best practice we’ll update our packages:

sudo yum -y update

Then let’s install Ansible and any required packages:

sudo yum -y install ansible

Step #3: Verify The Installation
Check the version of Ansible that is installed:

ansible --version


To add host in ansible server :-
We can add host by two ways. One way is to use same private key (.pem file) generated from interface to login to server.
Another is to generate different key for server to server communication.

For using different key follow below steps:-

(i)	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    one public key is generated along with rsa key.
(ii) Copy these files to /home/user/.ssh/ on  both server and host.

Important note :- File permissions should be appropriate otherwise khajjal ho jayoge.

give permission as chmod 600 key.pem

(iii) ansible all -m ping
Output:- 172.31.47.186 | success >> {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
(iv) to configure  hosts make entry in /etc/hosts of both server and host as well as in /etc/ansible/hosts on server.
